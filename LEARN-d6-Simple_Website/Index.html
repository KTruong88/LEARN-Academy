  <h1>Early Life</h1>
  <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, California. My first memories are of me during naptime in first grade. My next memory snapshot jumps to second grade where my grandma is walking me to my first day of elementary school.
    I was the king of four-square by the 4th grade. I remember inviting Mr. Underwood and Mr. Hubbs to play one day and they did. 
    Even the adults couldn't dethrone me.
  </p>

  <h1>Middle School</h1>
  <p>In middle school, nobody really played four-square. The main game played during lunch time at Taft Middle School was Tetherball. 
    Tetherball was my new passion, and I quickly dominated the courts at lunch. Kids would form lines to challenge my spot at the top.
